    The injected resource monitor allows injecting a synthetic resource
    pressure into Envoy via a text file, which must contain a floating-point
    number in the range [0..1] representing the resource pressure and be
    updated atomically by a symbolic link swap. This is intended primarily for
    integration tests to force Envoy into an overloaded state.
