    """
    This extension allows the session state to be tracked via cookies. This
    extension first encodes the address of the upstream host selected by the
    load balancer into a `set-cookie` response header with the :ref:`cookie
    configuration <envoy_v3_api_field_extensions.http.stateful_session.cookie.v
    3.CookieBasedSessionState.cookie>`. when new requests are incoming, this
    extension will try to parse the specific upstream host address by the
    cookie name. If the address parsed from the cookie corresponds to a valid
    upstream host, this upstream host will be selected first. See
    :ref:`stateful session filter <envoy_v3_api_msg_extensions.filters.http.sta
    teful_session.v3.StatefulSession>`. For example, if the cookie name is set
    to `sticky-host`, envoy will prefer `1.2.3.4:80` as the upstream host when
    the request contains the following header: .. code-block:: none     cookie:
    sticky-host="MS4yLjMuNDo4MA==" When processing the upstream response, if
    `1.2.3.4:80` is indeed the final choice the extension does nothing. If
    `1.2.3.4:80` is not the final choice, the new selected host will be used to
    update the cookie (via the `set-cookie` response header). [#extension:
