    Configuration for the SkipFilter match action. When matching results in
    this action, the associated filter will be ignored for all filter callbacks
    (e.g. `encodeHeaders`, `encodeData`, etc. for HTTP filters) after the
    matcher arrives at the match, including the callback that caused the match
    result. For example, when used with a HTTP filter and the match result was
    resolved after receiving the HTTP response headers, the HTTP filter will
    *not* receive the response header callback. As a result, if this match
    action is resolved before the first filter callback (e.g. HTTP request
    headers), the filter will be completely skipped.
