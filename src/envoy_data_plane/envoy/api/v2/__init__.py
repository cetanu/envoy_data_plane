    DeltaDiscoveryRequest and DeltaDiscoveryResponse are used in a new gRPC
    endpoint for Delta xDS. With Delta xDS, the DeltaDiscoveryResponses do not
    need to include a full snapshot of the tracked resources. Instead,
    DeltaDiscoveryResponses are a diff to the state of a xDS client. In Delta
    XDS there are per-resource versions, which allow tracking state at the
    resource granularity. An xDS Delta session is always in the context of a
    gRPC bidirectional stream. This allows the xDS server to keep track of the
    state of xDS clients connected to it. In Delta xDS the nonce field is
    required and used to pair DeltaDiscoveryResponse to a DeltaDiscoveryRequest
    ACK or NACK. Optionally, a response message level system_version_info is
    present for debugging purposes only. DeltaDiscoveryRequest plays two
    independent roles. Any DeltaDiscoveryRequest can be either or both of: [1]
    informing the server of what resources the client has gained/lost interest
    in (using resource_names_subscribe and resource_names_unsubscribe), or [2]
    (N)ACKing an earlier resource update from the server (using response_nonce,
    with presence of error_detail making it a NACK). Additionally, the first
    message (for a given type_url) of a reconnected gRPC stream has a third
    role: informing the server of the resources (and their versions) that the
    client already possesses, using the initial_resource_versions field. As
    with state-of-the-world, when multiple resource types are multiplexed
    (ADS), all requests/acknowledgments/updates are logically walled off by
    type_url: a Cluster ACK exists in a completely separate world from a prior
    Route NACK. In particular, initial_resource_versions being sent at the
    "start" of every gRPC stream actually entails a message for each type_url,
