    by the networking stack and/or listener filters. The following order
    applies: 1. Destination port. 2. Destination IP address. 3. Server name
    (e.g. SNI for TLS protocol), 4. Transport protocol. 5. Application
    protocols (e.g. ALPN for TLS protocol). 6. Source type (e.g. any, local or

    allow ranges or wildcards, the most specific value in any of the configured
    filter chains that matches the incoming connection is going to be used
    (e.g. for SNI ``www.example.com`` the most specific match would be
