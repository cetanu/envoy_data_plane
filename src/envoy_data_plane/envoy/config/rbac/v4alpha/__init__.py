    Role Based Access Control (RBAC) provides service-level and method-level
    access control for a service. RBAC policies are additive. The policies are
    examined in order. Requests are allowed or denied based on the `action` and
    whether a matching policy is found. For instance, if the action is ALLOW
    and a matching policy is found the request should be allowed. RBAC can also
    be used to make access logging decisions by communicating with access
    loggers through dynamic metadata. When the action is LOG and at least one
    policy matches, the `access_log_hint` value in the shared key namespace
    'envoy.common' is set to `true` indicating the request should be logged.
    Here is an example of RBAC configuration. It has two policies: * Service
    account "cluster.local/ns/default/sa/admin" has full access to the service,
    and so   does "cluster.local/ns/default/sa/superuser". * Any user can read
    ("GET") the service at paths with prefix "/products", so long as the
    destination port is either 80 or 443.  .. code-block:: yaml   action: ALLOW
